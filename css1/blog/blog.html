                I'm going to be a fashion icon in a minute. <br/>
                I'm not going to do it in a corny manner. <br/>
                I have a voice that speaks for a whole other market - not just black people,
                but high fashion urban people. <br/> I mix street wear with high fashion. <br/>
                It's never been seen before. <br/><br/>

                I have always loved fashion because it's a great way to express your mood. And I'm definitely a shoe lover.
                The right pair of shoes can change the feel of an outfit, and even change how a woman feels about herself.
                A woman can wear confidence on her feet with a high stiletto, or slip into weekend comfort with a soft ballet flat.
